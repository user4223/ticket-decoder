# The following xorg/system dependencies are required when opencv has to be built from source
# and cannot be loaded from conan-center in a pre-built version (non-std-compiler/config).
# They are required for highgui features. You can install them manually or
# set tools.system.package_manager:mode=install and tools.system.package_manager:sudo=True
# in conan config to get them installed via conan install as shown further below in "Setup conan" step.
# But the conan config breaks with dependency caching mechanism from github actions so
# we prefer an explicit installation here.
